      <p>You want to explore functional programming, but are put off by the academic feel (tell me about monads just one more time). You know you need concurrent applications, but also know these are almost impossible to get right.  Meet Elixir, a functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM.  Elixir&#8217;s pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. This book is <em>the</em> introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers.</p>


	<p>Maybe you need something that&#8217;s closer to Ruby, but with a battle-proven environment that&#8217;s unrivaled for massive scalability, concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it&#8217;s <em>Elixir</em>.</p>


	<p>Check out the short video on Elixir at <a href="http://youtu.be/hht9s6nAAx8">youtu.be/hht9s6nAAx8</a>, or the 30 minute, more detailed video at <a href="http://youtu.be/a-off4Vznjs">youtu.be/a-off4Vznjs</a> and enjoy.</p>


	<p>And don&#8217;t forget to download this handy <a href="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/elixir/ElixirCheat.pdf">cheat sheet</a> for Elixir syntax.</p>


	<h5><strong>Print books will be available after Elixir 1.0 has been finalized.</strong></h5>

	<p>Rails 3 was a major releaseâ€”the changes werenâ€™t just incremental, but structural. So we decided to follow suit. This book isnâ€™t just a mild reworking of the previous edition to make it run with the new Rails. Instead, itâ€™s a complete refactoring.</p>


	<p>Youâ€™ll still find the Depot example at the front, but youâ€™ll also find testing knitted right in. Gone are the long reference chaptersâ€”thatâ€™s what the web does best. Instead youâ€™ll find more targeted information on all the aspects of Rails youâ€™ll need to be a successful web developer.</p>

2. The requirements you do gather will change.<br />
3. There is always more to do than time and money will allow.<br /></p>

	<ul>
	<li>Work with confidence</li>
		<li>Work on a series of achievable steps instead of tackling a big problem all at once</li>
		<li>Ensure that software design meets the need of the actual code</li>
		<li>Leave behind a suite of tests to help preserve the integrity of the code</li>

      <p>Git has significantly changed the way teams develop software.  Its distributed nature and lightweight branching and merging have made it possible for developers to massage their code bases in ways they couldn&#8217;t have imagined before.  However, Git has a reputation for being hard to learn.  And when folks transition to Git, they often settle for using a handful of commands and treat Git just like their other source control system. 
But because of its different approach to source control issues, many of the techniques and terminology we have learned in other source control systems do not translate cleanly when using Git.  To begin to use Git effectively, you need to understand the underlying concepts.</p>


	<p>In this 49-minute screencast you&#8217;ll learn Git in a different way: By not learning about Git itself.  Instead, Jim Weirich takes you on a journey of how you might design and build a source control system from scratch.  Along the way you&#8217;ll gain a deeper understanding of the first principles behind Git so things begin to make more sense.</p>


	<p>This screencast is for people who haven&#8217;t used Git yet and are thinking about it, and for people who have just started using Git, but are still in the &#8220;magic incantation&#8221; stage of learning.  It&#8217;s a great introduction to source control for your manager, too!  No prior experience with Git or source control systems is required.</p>

First, he used the feedback from hundreds of reader e-mails to update the content and make it even clearer.  Second, he updated the examples in the book to use the latest stable version of Ruby, and also to use code that looks more like real-world Ruby code, so that people who have just learned to program will be more familiar with common Ruby techniques.</p>


	<p>Not only does the Second Edition now include answers to all of the exercises, it includes them <strong>twice</strong>.  First you&#8217;ll find the &#8220;how you could do it&#8221; answers, using the techniques you&#8217;ve learned up to that point in the book.  Next you&#8217;ll see &#8220;how Chris Pine would do it&#8221;: answers using more advanced Ruby techniques, to whet your  appetite as well as providing sort of a &#8220;Rosetta Stone&#8221; for more elegant solutions.</p>

how to test it reliably and repeatably.</p>


	<p>Many automated test frameworks promise the world and deliver nothing but headaches. Fortunately, you&#8217;ve got a secret weapon: Ruby. Ruby lets you build up a solution to fit your problem, rather than forcing your problem to fit into someone else&#8217;s idea of testing.</p>


	<p>This book is for people who want to get their hands dirty on examples from the real world&#8212;and who know that testing can be a joy when the tools don&#8217;t get in the way. It starts with the mechanics of simulating button pushes and keystrokes, and builds up to writing clear code, organizing tests, and beyond.</p>


	<h4>eBook</h4>


	<p>This version, last updated Jan 2012, refreshes the RSpec examples for version 2.x. It also contains an updated section on narrative-style tests, based on Cucumber 1.x. Ian has tweaked code samples throughout the book for compatibility with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, or JRuby 1.6.5, based on what the underlying libraries support.</p>

      <p>Imagine a true thin-client web application environment, with no browser incompatibilities, no plugins, and an interface that&#8217;s closer to a desktop app.  You can have it all, today. Welcome to The Dojo Toolkit.</p>


	<p><em>Mastering Dojo</em> walks you through the whole range of modern web programming problems, from bringing simple web pages to life with widgets and animation, to designing and building an enterprise-class, single-page Rich Internet Application (RIA).</p>


	<p>Are your web pages becoming more and more complex, with hundreds of lines of sprawling JavaScript as clients demand modern Ajax designs? Or maybe you&#8217;re about to enter the new world of single-page, Rich Internet Applications? Dojo is the unified toolkit that you need to get the job done.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">VERSIONS</span>:</strong> Applicable for Dojo Versions <strong>1.1 to 1.7</strong>. Versions 1.2 onward contain additional widgets, experimental api&#8217;s and bugfixes.  Please see the Dojorelease notes for detailed information.</p>

      <p>Pragmatic Project Automation shows you how to improve the consistency and repeatability of your project&#8217;s procedures using automation to reduce risk and errors.</p>


	<p>Simply put, we&#8217;re going to put this thing called a computer to work for you doing the mundane (but important) project stuff. That means you&#8217;ll have more time and energy to do the really exciting&mdash;and difficult&mdash;stuff, like writing quality code.</p>

      <p>Pragmatic programmers use feedback to drive their development and personal processes. The most valuable feedback you can get while coding comes from unit testing.</p>


	<p>Let your Java code tell you what&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t.  You&#8217;ll learn how to test using JUnit, but more importantly, you&#8217;ll learn <strong>what</strong> to test.</p>

      <p>Straight from the programming trenches, <em>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</em> cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core processâ€”what do you do, as an individual and as a team, if you want to create software that&#8217;s easy to work with and good for your users.</p>


	<p>This classic title is regularly featured on software development &#8220;Top Ten&#8221; lists, and is issued by many corporations to new hires.</p>


	<p>We wrote this book before we created our publishing business, and <strong>we do not publish it</strong>.  <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> is published by Addison Wesley, and may not contain the same ebook features or format the same as our Pragmatic Bookshelf books. Paperbacks are available wherever old-fashioned paperback books are sold, and the ebook is available here&#8212;all available ebook formats for one price, with <strong>no restrictive <span class="caps">DRM</span></strong>.</p>
